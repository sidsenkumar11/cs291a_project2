Sinatra
    - Simple Ruby framework
    - Easy to write API endpoints and requests against them

Google Cloud Run
    - Allows you to run containers in response to a web request
    - Pass HTTP request to the container
    - Different from AWS Lambda b/c Lambda only supports certain frameworks (Ruby, Python, etc). Those frameworks have specific formats that they take input/output
    - Cloud Run runs anything, as long as there's a port that it's listening on. And it's really meant for web requests.
    - Cost is about 2x cost of AWS
    - But, setup and deployment is easier than AWS
    - AWS Lambda doesn't work web requests natively; you have to first setup API gateway and associate the lambda with it

Service
    - REST based service on Google Cloud Resource
    - 4 primary API endpoints
        - GET /
            - Redirect to /files
        - GET /files
            - List of files has sha256, in sorted order. Lowercase the letters
        - POST /files
            - Respond 201 created, with JSON containing hash
        - Get, create, delete files
        - Get list of files
    - 1 redirect endpoint


Gemfile / Gemfile.lock
    - Specifications for Ruby for what packages are needed
    - bundle install builds Gemfile.lock and installs the gems locally

puma
    - Application server AND our HTTP server for this project
    - GCR will filter many requests and do some rate limiting, so not as necessary to have a separate HTTP server
    - Some weird requests do go through; in real production you'd probably still want to use nginx in front of it
